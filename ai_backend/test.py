shit
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:19 PM
any piazza posts?
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:19 PM
ye idk
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:18 PM
like they should be circled?
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:18 PM
you have that the two to the right wont be pruned right
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:18 PM
shit yea
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:17 PM
u right
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:17 PM
shit wait
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 1:16 PM
they will be pruned
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 12:08 PM
coming
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:44 AM
isnt worst cost gonna be like (1+Q) * min f(n) of the neighbours of the path we explore , and the path doesnt nessecarily have to be C^*
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:44 AM
how is it that we'll come across C^*
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:44 AM
yeah but in this one
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:42 AM
no matter what path we explore?
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:42 AM
like the optimal cost will be in the frontier?
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:42 AM
like isnt f(n) gonna be g(n) + h(n) and C^* is g(n) but we arent guaranteed to find it
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:42 AM
like how do we know the min in the frontier WILL be C^*?
Mark Zhang — 2025-02-24, 11:40 AM
u get 7b)?
